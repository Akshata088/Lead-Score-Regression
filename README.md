# Lead Scoring Model

This repository contains the implementation of a lead scoring model for **X Education**, an online education company. The objective is to identify high-potential leads (hot leads) that are more likely to convert into paying customers, thereby improving the company's lead conversion rate.

## Problem Statement

X Education has a lead conversion rate of about 30%, which is below their target of 80%. The company wishes to optimize its sales process by focusing on high-potential leads. This project involves building a **logistic regression model** to assign a lead score (0â€“100) to each lead, indicating their likelihood of conversion.

## Project Goals

1. Develop a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion.
2. Assign a lead score to each lead.
3. Provide actionable insights to improve the sales process.
4. Create reusable and adaptable solutions for future requirements.

## Data Description

- **Dataset**: ~9000 records containing features like Lead Source, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `Converted` (1 = Lead converted, 0 = Lead not converted).
- **Data Challenges**: Handling null values, 'Select' entries in categorical variables, and imbalanced data.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Well-documented Python code for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
   - Key visualizations to support the analysis.


## Results

- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Business Insight**:
  - Identification of key factors influencing lead conversion.
  - Recommendations to improve the lead nurturing process.
